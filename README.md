1. Overview:
AI Virtual Mouse is an intelligent system that enables users to control computer operations through real-time hand gestures using computer vision and deep learning. Leveraging MediaPipe, OpenCV, and PyAutoGUI, this project turns your webcam into a gesture recognition interface, allowing for contactless interaction with your system.

2. Key Features:

- Move the mouse pointer by tracking index finger position.

- Perform left click, right click, and double click with specific hand gestures.

- Take screenshots using pinch gestures.

- Switch between three modes: Normal, Presentation, and Gaming.

- Presentation mode supports next/previous slide gestures.

- Gaming mode allows jump action via thumbs-up gesture.

- Built-in gesture cooldown system to avoid accidental actions.

3. Technologies Used:

Python

OpenCV

MediaPipe

PyAutoGUI

Streamlit

4. Use Cases:

- Touchless PC interaction (e.g., for medical environments).

- Slide control during presentations without remote.

- Fun, interactive gesture-based gaming input.

- Accessibility support for limited mobility users.
